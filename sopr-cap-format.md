# Purpose

The following document was made as a proposal for the format of the Community Action Proposal, a document to be used to submit proposal to the Startups of Puerto Rico ( SoPR ) Community.

# Summary

The following document proposes the format for the CAP document to be used by SoPR. The format suggested follows loosely the format used by the Python PEP, with some changes. The format is made to be simple and straight forward to encourage member participation but at the same time to facilitate management and readability.

# Main

## What is a Community Action Proposal ( CAP )?

A document describing a proposal for an action to be taken by the Starups of Puerto Rico Community. These actions could be anything from help in marketing a product to a community activity.

## Why do we need a CAP?

It is a simple, fair, and open way for community members to participate in the governance of SoPR. It gives all community members and guest a way to voice opinion and proppse direction of SoPR and it also serves as a historical account of member opinion and community action.

## Who can submit a CAP?

Any one. This will not be limited to active community members. It is meant to foment participation and fair opportunity for all to voice opinions and concerns.

## Who will evaluate a CAP?

The SoPR board members will evaluate and answer CAPs as they arise and time allows.

## What should go into a CAP?

The following is the proposed use for a CAP:

-   -   Events a community member would like the community to participate or help organise or promote

    -   Changes to the community guide lines or governance.

## How does one submit a CAP?

A CAP can be submitted via email, uploaded in the [SoPR Google group](https://groups.google.com/group/startupspr), or as a pull request to the SoPR Github repo.

## What’s the format of a CAP

The CAP follows the Python PEP format very loosely. CAPs must be explicitly labeled in the public domain or be licensed under a public domain license such as the [Creative Commons Licence][] or the [Open Publication License][Attribution 3.0 Unported]. The file type should be an open format such as palin text (.txt), Open document format ( .odf ) or markdown ( .md ) - preferred - to allow free access to the document to all regardless of operating systems.

The document structure should follow the following guide lines:
